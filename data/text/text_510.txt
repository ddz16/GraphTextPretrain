The rate of free radical formation in aqueous solutions of ascorbic acid in the presence of chelating agents was measured by the ESR-stopped-flow method. Addition of ethylenediamine tetraacetate and trimetaphosphoric acid to the ascorbic acid-oxygen system results in only a minimal change in the rate of ascorbate free radical formation compared to that in absence of inhibitors. Evidence suggests that radical formation arises via secondary reactions involving products.
The stability constants of the complexes formed between the rare earth metal ions and the anion of trimetaphosphoric acid have been determined at a temperature of 20°C and an ionic strength of μ=0.1 by the ion-exchange equilibrium method. The investigations indicate that stabilities of complexes increased from La to Lu. The highest and the lowest stability constant values (β) were found to be 7.76 and 3.82 for Lu 3+ and La 3+ respectively.
