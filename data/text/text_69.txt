Tn5 insertion mutants of Pseudomonas cepacia G4 that were unable to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE), toluene, or phenol or to transform m-trifluoromethyl phenol (TFMP) to 7,7,7-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoic acid (TFHA) were produced. Spontaneous reversion to growth on phenol or toluene as the sole source of carbon was observed in one mutant strain, G4 5223, at a frequency of approximately 1 x 10(-4) per generation. One such revertant, G4 5223-PR1, metabolized TFMP to TFHA and degraded TCE. Unlike wild-type G4, G4 5223-PR1 constitutively metabolized both TFMP and TCE without aromatic induction. G4 5223-PR1 also degraded cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, and 1,1-dichloroethylene and oxidized naphthalene to alpha naphthol constitutively. G4 5223-PR1 exhibited a slight retardation in growth rate at TCE concentrations of > or = 530 microM, whereas G4 (which was unable to metabolize TCE under the same noninducing growth conditions) remained unaffected. The constitutive degradative phenotype of G4 5223-PR1 was completely stable through 100 generations of nonselective growth.

Abstract Pyrocatechase (catechol 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1.13.11.1), a ferric ion-containing dioxygenase from Pseudomonas arvilla C-1, catalyzes the intradiol cleavage of catechol with insertion of 2 atoms of molecular oxygen to form cis,cis-muconic acid. The enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of various catechol derivatives, including 4-methylcatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-formylcatechol (protocatechualdehyde), 4,5-dichlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 3-methylcatechol, 3-methoxycatechol, and 3-hydroxycatechol (pyrogallol). All of these substrates gave products having an absorption maximum at around 260 nm, which is characteristic of cis,cis-muconic acid derivatives. However, when 3-methylcatechol was used as substrate, the product formed showed two absorption maxima at 390 and 260 nm. These two absorption maxima were found to be attributable to two different products, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoic acid and 5-carboxy-2-methyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid (2-methylmuconic acid). The former was produced by the extradiol cleavage between the carbon atom carrying the hydroxyl group and the carbon atom carrying the hydroxyl group and the carbon atom carrying the methyl group; the latter by an intradiol cleavage between two hydroxyl groups. Since these products were unstable, they were converted to and identified as 6-methylpyridine-2-carboxylic acid and 2-methylmuconic acid dimethylester, respectively. Similarly, 3-methoxycatechol gave two products, namely, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxycarbonyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid and 5-carboxy-2-methoxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid (2-methoxymuconic acid). With 3-methylcatechol as substrate, the ratio of intradiol and extradiol cleavage activities of Pseudomonas pyrocatechase during purification was almost constant and was about 17. The final preparation of the enzyme was homogeneous when examined by disc gel electrophoresis and catalyzed both reactions simultaneously with the same ratio as during purification. All attempts to resolve the enzyme into two components with separate activities, including inactivation of the enzyme with urea or heat, treatment with sulfhydryl-blocking reagents or chelating agents, and inhibition of the enzyme with various inhibitors, proved unsuccessful. These results strongly suggest that Pseudomonas pyrocatechase is a single enzyme, which catalyzes simultaneously both intradiol and extradiol cleavages of some 3-substituted catechols.
Toluene-induced cells of Pseudomonas putida Fl removed trichloroethylene from growth media at a significantly greater initial rate than the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. With tolueneinduced P. putida Fl, the initial degradation rate varied linearly with trichloroethylene concentration over the range of 8 to 80 ,uM (1.05 to 10.5 ppm). At 80 ,uM (10.5 ppm) Organisms and culture conditions. The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . To generate cell mass for TCE transformation studies, P. putida F strains were grown on a mineral salts medium (20) containing 0.2% (wt/vol) L-arginine with toluene supplied in the vapor phase as described previously (3). Typically, 100-ml cultures in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks were grown at 30°C with shaking at 180 rpm. The revertant strain P. putida F4a was generated by inoculating P. putida F4 into mineral salts medium containing 0.02% (wt/vol) arginine and toluene supplied as before. The culture was grown to late exponential phase and transferred into fresh growth medium until a yellow color appeared in the culture filtrate, indicating that toluene was being oxidized to produce 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoic acid. Organisms were plated onto mineral salts solid medium containing 2% (wt/vol) agar with toluene supplied in the vapor phase as described previously (3) . A large colony was picked and designated P. putida F4a. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was grown on Higgins medium (4) at 30°C with shaking at 180 rpm under an atmosphere of 30% (vol/vol) methane in air. GC. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was conducted with a Hewlett-Packard 5790A series gas chromatograph equipped with a 30-m RSL-160 polydimethylsiloxane column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, Ill.) and electron capture or flame ionization detection systems. Samples were applied with a Hewlett-Packard 7672A autosampler, and peak integrations were obtained with a Hewlett-Packard 3390A integrator. The following operating conditions were used; injector temperature, 150°C; detector temperature (electron capture detector), 250°C; column temperature, 35°C run to 150°C at 15°C/min postinjection; hydrogen carrier flow, 6 ml/ min. Under these conditions, TCE and EDB (internal standard) had retention times of 5.3 and 6.9 min, respectively.
