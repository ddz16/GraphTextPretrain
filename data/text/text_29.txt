Sulfatases are unique in requiring an essential post-translational modification of a critical active-site cysteinyl or seryl residue to 3-oxoalanine usually called Cα-formylglycine (FGly). This post-translational modification is catalyzed anaerobically by anaerobic Sulfatase Maturating Enzyme (anSME), a member of the radical AdoMet superfamily. Using a new labeled substrate, we demonstrate that anSME uses a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical to catalyze direct H-atom abstraction from the substrate. We thus established that anSMEs are the first radical AdoMet enzymes catalyzing a post-translational modification involving Cβ H-atom abstraction from an active site cysteinyl or seryl residue. This mechanistic study allowed us to decipher the first steps of the mechanism of this new radical AdoMet enzyme family.
The ARSB gene is located on chromosome 5 (q11-q13) [10] . It has eight exons. The precursor of the ARSB enzyme has 533 amino acid residues, 36 of which constitute the signal peptide. Study of the crystal structure (PDB code: 1FSU) of the folded mature form of ARSB (MW 66 kDa) [11] reveals that the enzyme is a glycoprotein with two domains. The N-terminal domain (Domain 1) belongs to the α/β class and houses the active site. The C-terminal domain (Domain 2), whose function is not known, consists of a β sheet made of four antiparallel β strands and an α helix orthogonal to the sheet [11] . The active site pocket, located at the base of a cleft in Domain 1, has 10 evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. The cysteine 91 in the active site undergoes conversion to an aldehyde, 3-oxoalanine (2-amino-3-oxopropanoic acid), also called formylglycine. This post-translational modification is vital for the activity of the enzyme [12] . A Ca 2+ ion, present in the active site, acts as the cofactor and coordinates with seven atoms from the side chain groups of as many active site residues, and two oxygen atoms from the sulfate derivative of formylglycine [11] . Missense mutations form the largest group among the more than 160 mutations in the ARSB gene reported worldwide. Small insertions, splice site mutations, small and gross deletions and frameshift mutations comprise the remainder, according to the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [13] . The allelic heterogeneity observed in ARSB is high, which might, in part, explain the variable expressivity of MPS VI with respect to age of onset, rate of progression and clinical phenotypes [14] . Most mutations are "private". Some mutations are common, and a few of them have been attributed to founder effect [1, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ( [20] cited from Abstract). Study of influence of missense mutations on the overall structure and folding of ARSB helps to predict disease severity [24, 25] . It might also help in guiding the choice of personalized therapies for individual patients, when more therapies become available.
