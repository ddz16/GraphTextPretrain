The metabolic activities of 3 strains (KT-303, KT-304, and KT-305) of soil bacteria were tested on tryptophan and its benzoyl derivatives (Table I), and it was found that KT-303 and KT-305 metabolized benzoyl-DL-tryptophan to produce L-tryptophan and benzoyl-D-tryptophan respectively.Two strains (KT-230 and KT-231) of soil bacteria had the activity to metabolize benzoyl derivatives of 2-aminohexanedioic acid and 2-aminooctanoic acids to yield L-2-aminohexanedioic acid, N-benzoyl-D-2-aminohexanedioic acid, L-2-aminooctanoic acid, and N-benzoyl-D-2-aminooctanoic acid respectively.
Abstract Incorporation of DL -2-aminohexanedioic acid, DL -2-amino-5-methoxycarbonyl-pentanoic acid and DL -methionine into 3-methoxycarbonylpropylglucosinolate have been demonstrated using an Erystmum species. The data support the following sequence of biosynthetic reactions: 2-aminohexanedioic acid is methylated by methionine; the resulting 2-amino-5-methoxycarbonyl-pentanoic acid is then converted into the glucosinolate. 2-Amino-5-methoxycarbonyl-pentanoic acid has been tentatively identified as a natural product in the plant.
