1. In addition to the known 2R,3R- and 2R, 3S-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acids (DHI), the 1S,3S- and sS,DR-isomers were prepared. 2S-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid (DHV) was also prepared in addition to the known 2R-isomer. 2. The six dihydroxy acids were examined for their ability to promote the growth of isoleucine-valine (ilv)-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium and to serve as substrates for the alpha,beta-dihydroxyacid dehydratase of the same organism. 3. Only 2R,3R-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic and 2R-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acids supported growth of the ilv strains of S. typhimurium. 4. alpha,beta-Dihydroxyacid dehydratase utilized the three isomers with the 2R-configuration as substrates but not those with the 2S-configuration. 5. In an additional growth study that utilized the 3R- and 3S-isomers of 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, the alpha-keto acid analogue of isoleucine, only the 3S-isomer supported growth. 6. It is concluded that the mechanism of action of the dehydratase is stereospecific in that the proton that is attached to C-3 of the substrate occupies the same steriochemical position as the departing hydroxyl group (Fig. 6).
The Grignard reaction of 3-O-benzyl-6-deoxy-1,2-O-isopropylidene-α-D-xylo-hexofuranos-5-ulose (5) with ethylmagnesium bromide yielded 3-O-benzyl-6-deoxy-5-C-ethyl-1,2-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose (6) as a major product in 91% stereoselectivity. Hydrolysis of 6 followed by successive periodate oxidation and lithium aluminium hydride reduction gave 2-O-benzyl-5-deoxy-4-C-ethyl-D-arabinitol. Selective benzoylation of 9 followed by successive 3,4-O-isopropylidenation, debenzoylation, hydrogenolysis, and two-stage oxidation with periodate-hypoiodite afforded (4R,5S)-(+)-5-ethyl-2,2,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-carboxylic acid (15) in 24.6% overall yield from 5. Hydrolysis of 15 gave (2R,3S)-(−)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid. The acetonide 15 is usefull as a synthon for pyridomycin synthesis.
(2RS,3RS)- and (2RS,3SR)-2,3-Dihydroxybutanoic acids, (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methypentanoic acid, (2RS)-2-ethyl-2,3-dihydroxypentanoic acid, (2RS,3RS)- and (2RS,3SR)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acids, and (2RS,3RS)- and (2RS,3SR)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylheptanoic acids were synthesised. These acids, as well as (RS)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid and (RS)-glyceric acid were tested as substrates for the αβ-dihydroxyacid dehydratase of the isoteucine–valine biosynthetic pathway of Salmonella typhimurium. For acids having a propyl group at C-3, the activities were greatly reduced compared with those obtained for the natural substrates (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid [(2R,3R)-DHI] and (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid [(R)-DHV]. For acids having an n-butyl substituent at C-3, the activities were close to zero. (2RS,3SR)-2,3-Dihydroxybutanoic acid (threo-isomer) underwent dehydration at a rate comparable with that of (2R,3R)-DHI, the natural substrate in the isoteucine pathway, whereas the (2RS,3RS)-acid (erythro-isomer) had much lower activity and (RS)-glyceric acid had even less activity. These results illustrate differences in the alkyl group requirements with respect to the areas of the binding site of the enzyme that accommodate the C-3 substituents. They also demonstrate the size limits of the alkyl groups that can be accommodated in substrate. analogues.
Abstract 1. 1. In addition to the known 2R,3R- and 2R, 3S-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acids (DHI), the 2S,3S- and 2S,3R-isomers were prepared. 2S-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid (DHV) was also prepared in addition to the known 2R-isomer. 2. 2. The six dihydroxy acids were examined for their ability to promote the growth of isoleucine-valine (ilv)-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium and to serve as substrates fro the α,β-dihydroxyacid dehydratase of the same organism. 3. 3. Only 2R,3R-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic and 2R-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acids supported growth of the ilv strains of S. typhimurium. 4. 4. α,β-Dihydroxyacid dehydratase utilized the three isomers with the 2R-configuration as substrates but not those with the 2S-configuration. 5. 5. In an additional growth study that utilized the 3R- and 3S-isomers of 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, the α-keto acid analogue of isoleucine, only the 3S-isomer supported growth. 6. 6. It is concluded that the mechanism of action of the dehydratase is stereospecific in that the proton that is attached to C-3 of the substrate occupies the same stereochemical position as the departing hydroxyl group (Fig. 6).
