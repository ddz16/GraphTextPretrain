The mycelium collected from the culture broth (1 l) by centrifugation was extracted with Me 2 CO (200 ml). After concentration in vacuo, the residue aqueous concentrate with pH adjusted to 2-3 using 2 N HCl was extracted twice with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated in vacuo. The dried residue (180 mg) was subjected to normal-phase medium-pressure liquid chromatography (Purif-Pack SI-60, size: 20, Moritex, Tokyo, Japan) with a Hexane-EtOAc (0-30% EtOAc) linear gradient system, followed by elution with a CHCl 3 -MeOH (0-90% MeOH) linear gradient system; then, peak detection was carried out with UV absorption at 254 nm. The 10-20% MeOH elute fractions (30 mg) were further purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a PEGASIL ODS column (Senshu Pak, 20 i.d.Ã‚150 mm, Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) with a H 2 O-MeOH (0-100% MeOH) linear gradient system containing 0.1% formic acid to yield JBIR-69 (1, 15 mg) together with 3-isopropylmalate methyl ester (6 mg). 3 Compound 1 The structure of 1 was mainly elucidated by the analyses of NMR spectra, including heteronuclear single-quantum coherence, doublequantum-filtered correlation (DQF-COSY), and constant-time heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC). 4 The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data revealed by the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectrum for 1 are listed in Table 1 . The DQF-COSY and HMBC analyses revealed the two partial structures (Figure 1b) . The sequence from an amide proton 2-NH (d H 6.68) to methylene protons 3-H (d H 3.67 and 3.22) through an a-methine proton 2-H (d H 4.91, d C 52.2) was observed in the DQF-COSY of 1. In the HMBC spectrum, 1 H-13 C longrange couplings from the a-methine proton 2-H and the methylene protons 3-H to a carbonyl carbon C-1 (d C 171.6), and from the amide proton 2-NH and a singlet methyl proton 10-H (d H 2.12) to an amide carbonyl carbon C-9 (d C 172.4) were observed. Thus, the carbonyl and acetyl moieties were elucidated to be substituted at the C-2 and 2-N positions, respectively. In a similar manner, the sequence from an oxymethine proton 6-H (d functional group. By taking into consideration the molecular formula of 1 and the long-range coupling from 3-H to C-4, together with the 13 C chemical shifts of C-3 (d C 29.7) and C-4, these partial structures should be connected through a sulfur atom. Finally, the structure of 1 was determined to be 2-acetamido-3-(3-hydroxy-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoylthio)propanoic acid, as shown in Figure 1 . This structure was also supported by alkaline hydrolysis (2 N NaOH, 40 1C, 1 h), which yielded an N-acetyl cystein and 2-hydroxy-3-isopropylsuccinic acid residues.
