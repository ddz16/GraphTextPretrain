Several studies have shown that astrocytes release neurotransmitters into the extracellular space that may then activate receptors on nearby neurons. In the present study, the actions of adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADPbetaS)-activated astrocyte conditioned medium (ADPbetaS-ACM) on cultured dorsal spinal cord neurons were evaluated by using confocal laser scanning microscopy and whole-cell patch-clamp recording. ADPbetaS caused astrocytic glutamate efflux (43 microM), which in turn induced inward currents in dorsal horn neurons with short time in culture. The inward currents were abolished by 2-amino-5-phosphonlanoicacid (AP-5; NMDAR antagonist) plus 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; non-NMDAR antagonist) but were unaffected by MRS2179 (selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonist). Furthermore, N6-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2179) was used to block glutamate release from astrocytes. As a result, ADPbetaS-ACM-induced inward currents in neurons were significantly blocked. On the other hand, both NMDAR and non-NMDAR were involved in ADPbetaS-ACM (concentration was diluted to one-tenth)-evoked small [Ca(2+)](i) transients in neurons. Under this condition, the values of glutamate concentrations in the medium are close to values for extracellular glutamate concentrations under physiological conditions. For this reason, it is possible that astrocyte-derived glutamate is important for distant neuron under physiological conditions at dorsal spinal cord. These observations indicate that astrocytic P2Y(1) receptor activation triggered glutamate efflux, which acts on distant neurons to elevate calcium levels or acts on nearby neurons to evoke inward current. Finally, our results support the conclusion that the astrocytic P2Y(1) receptor plays an important role in bidirectional communication between astrocytes and neurons.
ATP is released in a vesicular manner from nerve terminals mainly at higher stimulation frequencies. There is a robust expression of ATP (P2) receptors in the brain, but their role is primarily unknown. We report that ATP analogs biphasically modulate the evoked release of glutamate from purified nerve terminals of the rat hippocampus, the facilitation being mediated by P2X1, P2X2/3, and P2X3 [antagonized by 8-(benzamido)naphthalene-1,3,5-trisulfonate and 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP] and the inhibition by P2Y1, P2Y2, and/or P2Y4 [antagonized by reactive blue 2 and 2'deoxy-N6-methyladenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate and mimicked by P1-(urinine 5'-),P4-(inosine 5'-) tetraphosphate and 2-methylthio-ADP] receptors. The combination of single-cell PCR analysis of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons, Western blot analysis of purified presynaptic active zone fraction, and immunocytochemical analysis of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals revealed that the P2 receptors expressed in glutamatergic neurons, located in the active zone and in glutamatergic terminals, were precisely P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3 subunits and P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors. This provides coincident functional and molecular evidence that P2 receptors are present and act presynaptically as a modulatory system controlling hippocampal glutamate release.
An isoenzyme of phenol sulphotransferase, designated P-STG, was purified 157-fold from male rat liver cytosol by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose) and agarose-hexane-adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate affinity chromatography. The P-STG fraction obtained after DEAE-cellulose chromatography rapidly lost its activity during storage at 4 degrees C, however, the activity was recovered by the addition of 1.6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gndn HCl) followed by dialysis. Gndn HCl also substantially improved the yield of P-STG in a subsequent purification step using affinity chromatography, while the specific activity of the purified P-STG was not changed by Gndn HCl treatment. It is possible that the Gndn HCl treatment caused P-STG recovery from an inactivated to an active form rather than reactivating it for increased activity. Purified P-STG is a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 67 kDa; the subunit molecular mass is 35 kDa. Immunoblot analysis carried out with antibodies raised against the purified enzyme indicated that male rat liver contains a higher level of the enzyme than female rat liver. This enzyme is also expressed in the kidney and the stomach. P-STG reaches maximum activity when 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol and 4-nitrophenol are used as substrates at pH 5.5. Using dopamine as a substrate the pH optimum is about 9.0. P-STG activity is markedly inhibited by the addition of sodium chloride to the reaction mixture.
We have shown previously that stimulation of heterologously expressed P2Y1 nucleotide receptors inhibits M-type K+ currents in sympathetic neurons. We now report that activation of endogenous P2Y1 receptors induces inhibition of the M-current in rat CA1/CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells in primary neuron cultures. The P2Y1 agonist adenosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate trilithium salt (ADPbetaS) inhibited M-current by up to 52% with an IC50 of 84 nM. The hydrolyzable agonist ADP (10 microM) produced 32% inhibition, whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 agonist DHPG [(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] (10 microM) inhibited M-current by 44%. The M-channel blocker XE991 [10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone dihydrochloride] produced 73% inhibition at 3 microM; neither ADPbetaS nor ADP produced additional inhibition in the presence of XE991. The effect of ADPbetaS was prevented by a specific P2Y1 antagonist, MRS 2179 (2'-deoxy-N'-methyladenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate tetra-ammonium salt) (30 microM). Inhibition of the M-current by ADPbetaS was accompanied by increased neuronal firing in response to injected current pulses. The neurons responding to ADPbetaS were judged to be pyramidal cells on the basis of (1) morphology, (2) firing characteristics, and (3) their distinctive staining for the pyramidal cell marker neurogranin. Strong immunostaining for P2Y1 receptors was shown in most cells in these cultures: 74% of the cells were positive for both P2Y1 and neurogranin, whereas 16% were only P2Y1 positive. These results show the presence of functional M-current-inhibitory P2Y1 receptors on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, as predicted from their effects when expressed in sympathetic neurons. However, the mechanism of inhibition in the two cell types seems to differ because, unlike nucleotide-mediated M-current inhibition in sympathetic neurons, that in hippocampal neurons did not appear to result from raised intracellular calcium.
To investigate the role of purinergic P2 receptors under ischemia, we studied the effect of P2 receptor antagonists on synaptic transmission and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in rat hippocampal slices. The effect of the P2 antagonists pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonate (PPADS, unselective, 30 μm), N( 6) -methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2179, selective for P2Y(1) receptor, 10 μm), Brilliant Blue G (BBG, selective for P2X(7) receptor, 1 μm), and 5-[[[(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl][(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]carbonyl]-1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid (A-317491, selective for P2X(3) receptor, 10 μm), and of the newly synthesized P2X(3) receptor antagonists 2-amino-9-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxybenzyl)adenine (PX21, 1 μm) and 2-amino-9-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxybenzyl)-N( 6)-methyladenine (PX24, 1 μm), on the depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and anoxic depolarization (AD) elicited by 7 min of OGD were evaluated. All antagonists significantly prevented these effects. The extent of CA1 cell injury was assessed 3 h after the end of 7 min of OGD by propidium iodide staining. Substantial CA1 pyramidal neuronal damage, detected in untreated slices exposed to OGD injury, was significantly prevented by PPADS (30 μm), MRS2179 (10 μm), and BBG (1 μm). Western blot analysis showed that, 10 min after the end of the 7 min of OGD, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 MAPK activation was significantly increased. MRS2179, BBG, PPADS and A-317491 significantly counteracted ERK1/2 activation. Hippocampal slices incubated with the ERK1/2 inhibitors 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene (U0126, 10 μm) and α-[amino[(4-aminophenyl)thio]methylene]-2-(trifluoromethyl) benzeneacetonitrile (SL327, 10 μm) showed significant fEPSP recovery after OGD and delayed AD, supporting the involvement of ERK1/2 in neuronal damage induced by OGD. These results indicate that subtypes of hippocampal P2 purinergic receptors have a harmful effect on neurotransmission in the CA1 hippocampus by participating in AD appearance and activation of ERK1/2.
We synthesized a series of adenine/guanine 2',3'- or 3',5'-bisphosphate and -bisphosphorothioate analogues, 1-6, as potential Cu(+)/Fe(2+) chelators, with a view to apply them as biocompatible and water-soluble antioxidants. We found that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-monitored inhibition of OH radicals production from H2O2, in an Fe(2+)-H2O2 system, by bisphosphate derivatives 1, 3, and 5 (IC50 = 36, 24, and 40 μM, respectively), was more effective than it was by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), by a factor of 1.5, 2, and 1.4, respectively. Moreover, 2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate, 1, was 1.8- and 4.7-times more potent than adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), respectively. The bisphosphorothioate derivatives 2, 4, and 6 (IC50 = 92, 50, and 80 μM, respectively), exhibited a dual antioxidant activity, acting as both metal-ion chelators and radical scavengers [2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assay data indicates IC50 = 50, 70, and 108 μM vs 27 μM for Trolox]. Only 2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphorothioate, 2, exhibited good inhibition of Cu(+)-induced H2O2 decomposition (IC50 = 78 vs 224 μM for EDTA). Nucleoside-bisphosphorothioate analogues (2, 4, and 6) were weaker inhibitors than the corresponding bisphosphate analogues (1, 3, and 5), due to intramolecular oxidation under Fenton reaction conditions. (1)H- and (31)P NMR monitored Cu(+) titration of 2, showed that Cu(+) was coordinated by both 3',5'-bisphosphorothioate groups, as well as N7-nitrogen atom, while adenosine-2',3'-bisphosphorothioate, 6, coordinated Cu(+) only by 2',3'-bisphosphorothioate groups. In conclusion, an additional terminal phosphate group on AMP/guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) resulted in Fe(2+)-selective chelators highly potent as Fenton reaction inhibitors.
Phenol sulfotransferases (SULT1s, EC 2.8.2.1) catalyze sulfuryl group transfer from 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the hydroxyl oxygen of aromatic acceptor substrates. Previous work with the bovine SULT1A1 has utilized the highly fluorescent substrate 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC, umbelliferone) as an acceptor substrate [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 261 (1999) 815]. Here we report that adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (PAP)-dependent binding of 7-HC to bSULT1A1 can be observed due to the appearance of a 400-420-nm shoulder in the emission spectrum, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. This emission was observed by placing 7-HC in ethanol, which is consistent with bSULT1A1 phenol binding site hydrophobicity. Titrations with 7-HC indicate a K(d) for 7-HC of 0.58 microM and substoichiometric binding to the homodimeric enzyme. The bSULT1A1:PAP:7-HC complex could be disrupted with pentachlorophenol (PCP), titrations with which indicated 0.5 equivalents per enzyme subunit. Titrations of enzyme plus 7-HC with PAP also indicated 0.5 equivalents per enzyme subunit. These results suggest a model of homodimeric bSULT1A1 in which subunit interactions favor half-site reactivity in the formation of a dead end complex.
Muller cells express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors that permit them to sensethe extracellular environment within the retina. We have used a battery of agonists and antagonists to characterize the purinergic receptor subtypes expressed on isolated tiger salamander Muller cells. Changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in Muller cells were measured using the Ca 2+ indicator dye Fura-2 and digital imaging microscopy. ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, 2-methylthio-ADP, ADP, UTP, UDP, deoxyATP, and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP evoked increases in [Ca 2+ ] i in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca 2+ Therefore, the increases we observed were likely due to intracellular Ca 2+ release mediated by G-protein-coupled P2Y receptor activation, rather than Ca 2+ influx via P2X receptor channels. The P2Y 1 receptor agonists 2-methylthio-ATP, 2-methylthio-ADP, and ADP evoked increases in [Ca 2+ ] i that were inhibited by the P2Y 1 receptor antagonists adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate and 2'-deoxy-N6-methyleneadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate. Responses to ADP were not completely inhibited by the P2Y 1 receptor antagonists. The residual response to ADP could be mediated by P2Y 13 receptors. UTP evoked an increase in [Ca 2+ ] i that was partially inhibited by suramin, suggesting that Muller cells express P2Y 2 and P2Y 4 receptors. The P2Y 6 receptor agonist UDP, and the P2Y 11 receptor agonists deoxyATP, and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP, evoked increases in [Ca 2+ ] i in Muller cells. We conclude that isolated tiger salamander Muller cells express P2Y 1 , P2Y 2 , P2Y 6 , P2Y 11 , and possibly P2Y 4 and P2Y 13 receptors. Therefore, the physiological release of ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP and/or their accumulation in the retina under pathological conditions could stimulate increases in [Ca 2+ ] i in Muller cells.

Membrane-bound P2-receptors mediate the actions of extracellular nucleotides in cell-to-cell signalling. P2X-receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, whereas P2Y-receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). So far, the P2Y family is composed out of 8 human subtypes that have been cloned and functionally defined; species orthologues have been found in many vertebrates. P2Y1-, P2Y2-, P2Y4-, P2Y6-, and P2Y11-receptors all couple to stimulation of phospholipase C. The P2Y11-receptor mediates in addition a stimulation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, activation of the P2Y12-, P2Y13-, and P2Y14-receptors causes an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The expression of P2Y1-receptors is widespread. The receptor is involved in blood platelet aggregation, vasodilatation and neuromodulation. It is activated by ADP and ADP analogues including 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP). 2'-Deoxy-N6-methyladenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2179) and 2-chloro-N6-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2279) are potent and selective antagonists. P2Y2 transcripts are abundantly distributed. One important example for its functional role is the control of chloride ion fluxes in airway epithelia. The P2Y2-receptor is activated by UTP and ATP and blocked by suramin. The P2Y2-agonist diquafosol is used for the treatment of the dry eye disease. P2Y4-receptors are expressed in the placenta and in epithelia. The human P2Y4-receptor has a strong preference for UTP as agonist, whereas the rat P2Y4-receptor is activated about equally by UTP and ATP. The P2Y4-receptor is not blocked by suramin. The P2Y6-receptor has a widespread distribution including heart, blood vessels, and brain. The receptor prefers UDP as agonist and is selectively blocked by 1,2-di-(4-isothiocyanatophenyl)ethane (MRS2567). The P2Y11-receptor may play a role in the differentiation of immunocytes. The human P2Y11-receptor is activated by ATP as naturally occurring agonist and it is blocked by suramin and reactive blue 2 (RB2). The P2Y12-receptor plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation as well as in inhibition of neuronal cells. It is activated by ADP and very potently by 2-methylthio-ADP. Nucleotide antagonists including N6-(2-methylthioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)-beta,gamma-dichloromethylene-ATP (=cangrelor; AR-C69931MX), the nucleoside analogue AZD6140, as well as active metabolites of the thienopyridine compounds clopidogrel and prasugrel block the receptor. These P2Y12-antagonists are used in pharmacotherapy to inhibit platelet aggregation. The P2Y13-receptor is expressed in immunocytes and neuronal cells and is again activated by ADP and 2-methylthio-ADP. The 2-chloro-5-nitro pyridoxal-phosphate analogue 6-(2'-chloro-5'-nitro-azophenyl)-pyridoxal-alpha5-phosphate (MRS2211) is a selective antagonist. mRNA encoding for the human P2Y14-receptor is found in many tissues. However, a physiological role of the receptor has not yet been established. UDP-glucose and related analogues act as agonists; antagonists are not known. Finally, UDP has been reported to act on receptors for cysteinyl leukotrienes as an additional agonist--indicating a dual agonist specificity of these receptors.
ATP is released during hypoxia from the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and activates purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) at unknown loci to offset the secondary hypoxic depression of breathing. In this study, we used rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal rat to map, in relation to anatomical and molecular markers of the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) (a proposed site of rhythm generation), the effects of ATP on respiratory rhythm and identify the P2R subtypes responsible for these actions. Unilateral microinjections of ATP in a three-dimensional grid within the VLM revealed a "hotspot" where ATP (0.1 mM) evoked a rapid 2.2 +/- 0.1-fold increase in inspiratory frequency followed by a brief reduction to 0.83 +/- 0.02 of baseline. The hotspot was identified as the preBötC based on histology, overlap of injection sites with NK1R immunolabeling, and potentiation or inhibition of respiratory frequency by SP ([Sar9-Met(O2)11]-substance P) or DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin), respectively. The relative potency of P2R agonists [2MeSADP (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate) approximately = 2MeSATP (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate) approximately = ATPgammas (adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate tetralithium salt) approximately = ATP >> UTP approximately = alphabeta meATP (alpha,beta-methylene-adenosine 5'-triphosphate)] and attenuation of the ATP response by MRS2179 (2'-deoxy-N6-methyladenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate) (P2Y1 antagonist) indicate that the excitation is mediated by P2Y1Rs. The post-ATP inhibition, which was never observed in response to ATPgammas, is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. These data establish in neonatal rats that respiratory rhythm generating networks in the preBötC are exquisitely sensitive to P2Y1R activation, and suggest a role for P2Y1Rs in respiratory motor control, particularly in the P2R excitation of rhythm that occurs during hypoxia.
The sodium- and chloride-coupled glycine neurotransmitter transporters (GLYTs) control the availability of glycine at glycine-mediated synapses. The mainly glial GLYT1 is the key regulator of the glycine levels in glycinergic and glutamatergic pathways, whereas the neuronal GLYT2 is involved in the recycling of synaptic glycine from the inhibitory synaptic cleft. In this study, we report that stimulation of P2Y purinergic receptors with 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate in rat brainstem/spinal cord primary neuronal cultures and adult rat synaptosomes leads to the inhibition of GLYT2 and the stimulation of GLYT1 by a paracrine regulation. These effects are mainly mediated by the ADP-preferring subtypes P2Y(1) and P2Y(13) because the effects are partially reversed by the specific antagonists N(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-6-azo(2-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)-2,4-disulfonate and are totally blocked by suramin. P2Y(12) receptor is additionally involved in GLYT1 stimulation. Using pharmacological approaches and siRNA-mediated protein knockdown methodology, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GLYT regulation. Modulation takes place through a signaling cascade involving phospholipase C activation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, protein kinase C stimulation, nitric oxide formation, cyclic guanosine monophosphate production, and protein kinase G-I (PKG-I) activation. GLYT1 and GLYT2 are differentially sensitive to NO/cGMP/PKG-I both in brain-derived preparations and in heterologous systems expressing the recombinant transporters and P2Y(1) receptor. Sensitivity to 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate by GLYT1 and GLYT2 was abolished by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of nitric-oxide synthase. Our data may help define the role of GLYTs in nociception and pain sensitization.
We characterized the pharmacological properties of P2 receptors expressed in G292 osteoblastic cells by studying the responses or changes in intracellular Ca(2+) level to P2 receptor agonists, antagonists and modulators. ATP induced robust responses in a concentration-dependent manner with EC(50) of 0.5+/-0.07 microM. While alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (alphabetameATP) and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) were ineffective, ADP mimicked the action of ATP with EC(50) of 0.7+/-0.2 microM. UTP and UDP also evoked responses with EC(50) of 2.0+/-0.4 microM and 0.5+/-0.1 microM respectively, but their responses were much smaller, resulting in an order of the response magnitude: ATP~ADP>>UTP~UDP. The responses evoked by ATP and ADP were blocked by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2,4,-disulfonate (PPADS) with IC(50) of 3.0+/-0.05 microM and 5.0+/-0.4 microM respectively, but not by suramin up to 30 microM. ATP-evoked responses were insensitive to inhibition by trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) and brilliant blue G. ADP-evoked responses were significantly inhibited by 2'-deoxy-N(6)-methyladenosine-3',5'-biphosphate (MRS2179) and 2-chloro-N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2279) with IC(50) of 48+/-1.9 microM and 7.7+/-0.9 microM respectively. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for functional expression of ATP-sensitive P2Y receptors and particularly P2Y(1)-like receptor in G292 cells.
The P2Y(1) receptor is a prothrombotic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by ADP. Preference for the North (N) ring conformation of the ribose moiety of adenine nucleotide 3',5'-bisphosphate antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor was established by using a ring-constrained methanocarba (a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) ring as a ribose substitute. A series of covalently linkable N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphates containing extended 2-alkynyl chains was designed, and binding affinity at the human (h) P2Y(1) receptor determined. The chain of these functionalized congeners contained hydrophilic moieties, a reactive substituent, or biotin, linked via an amide. Variation of the chain length and position of an intermediate amide group revealed high affinity of carboxylic congener 8 (K(i) 23 nM) and extended amine congener 15 (K(i) 132 nM), both having a 2-(1-pentynoyl) group. A biotin conjugate 18 containing an extended epsilon-aminocaproyl spacer chain exhibited higher affinity than a shorter biotinylated analogue. Alternatively, click coupling of terminal alkynes of homologous 2-dialkynyl nucleotide derivatives to alkyl azido groups produced triazole derivatives that bound to the P2Y(1) receptor following deprotection of the bisphosphate groups. The preservation of receptor affinity of the functionalized congeners was consistent with new P2Y(1) receptor modeling and ligand docking. Attempted P2Y(1) antagonist conjugation to PAMAM dendrimer carriers by amide formation or palladium-catalyzed reaction between an alkyne on the dendrimer and a 2-iodopurine-derivatized nucleotide was unsuccessful. A dialkynyl intermediate containing the chain length favored in receptor binding was conjugated to an azide-derivatized dendrimer, and the conjugate inhibited ADP-promoted human platelet aggregation. This is the first example of attaching a strategically functionalized P2Y receptor antagonist to a PAMAM dendrimer to produce a multivalent conjugate exhibiting a desired biological effect, i.e., antithrombotic action.
A previous study around adenine nucleotides afforded the reference N(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (1a, MRS 2179) as a selective human P2Y(1) receptor antagonist (pA(2)=6.55+/-0.05) with antithrombotic properties. In the present paper, we have synthesized and tested in vitro various 2-substituted derivatives with the goal of exploring the 2-position binding region and developing more potent P2Y(1) receptor antagonists. Thus, we have adopted a novel and versatile chemical pathway using a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with the 2-iodinated derivative 7 as a common intermediate for a very efficient synthesis of the 2-alkyl-N(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate nucleotides 1e-i. The biological activity was evaluated through the ability of compounds to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation, intracellular calcium rise and to displace the specific binding of [(33)P]2-MeSADP. 2-Ethyl and 2-propyl groups appeared to be tolerated, whereas a bulky group or a C(3) linear substituent dramatically decreased potency of antagonists. The 2-ethynyl derivative 1h (pA(2)=7.54+/-0.10) was significantly more potent (10-fold) as an antagonist when compared to the reference 1a, revealing a potential electronic interaction highly favorable between triple bond orbitals and the P2Y(1) receptor at this position.
1. We reported previously that bisphosphate derivatives of adenosine are antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor and that modification of the ribose in these analogues is tolerated in the P2Y(1) receptor binding pharmacophore. 2. Here we delineate the pharmacological activity of one such non-nucleotide molecule, 2-chloro N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2279), in which the ribose is replaced by a cyclopentane ring constrained in the (N)-conformation by a cyclopropane moiety. 3. MRS2279 antagonized 2MeSADP-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in turkey erythrocyte membranes with competitive kinetics (pK(B)=7.75). High affinity competitive antagonism by MRS2279 was also observed at the human P2Y(1) receptor (pK(B)=8.10) stably expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. Antagonism was specific for the P2Y(1) receptor since MRS2279 had no effect on activation of the human P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(6), or P2Y(11) receptors by their cognate agonists. 4. MRS2279 also did not block the capacity of ADP to act through the Gi/adenylyl cyclase linked P2Y receptor of platelets to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation. 5. In contrast, the P2Y(1) receptor is known to be obligatory in the process of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and MRS2279 competitively inhibited ADP-promoted platelet aggregation with an apparent affinity (pK(B)=8.05) similar to that observed at the human P2Y(1) receptor heterologously expressed in 1321N1 cells. 6. Taken together these results illustrate selective high affinity antagonism of the P2Y(1) receptor by a non-nucleotide molecule that should prove useful for pharmacological delineation of this receptor in various tissues.
We investigated the effects of the ATP analogue and P2 receptor agonist 2-ClATP on growth and survival of different neuronal (PC12, PC12nnr5 and SH-SY5Y) and glial (U87 and U373) cell lines, by the use of direct count of intact nuclei, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2-ClATP lowered the number of cultured PC12nnr5, SH-SY5Y, U87 and U373 cells to almost 5%, and of PC12 cells to about 35% after 3-4 days of treatment. EC(50) was in the 5-25 microM range, with 2-ClATP behaving as a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent. Analysis of the biological mechanisms demonstrated that pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (P2 receptor antagonist and nucleotidases inhibitor), but not Caffeine or CGS-15493 (P1 receptor antagonists) effectively prevented 2-ClATP-induced toxicity. 2-ClATP metabolic products (2-ClADP, 2-ClAMP, 2-Cladenosine) and new synthesis derivatives (2-CldAMP, 2-Cldadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate and 2-CldATP) exerted similar cytotoxic actions. Inhibition of both serum nucleotidases and purine nucleoside transporters strongly reduced 2-ClATP-induced cell death, which was conversely increased by the nucleotide hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase. The adenosine kinase inhibitor 5-iodotubericidin totally prevented 2-ClATP or 2-Cladenosine-induced toxicity. In summary, our findings indicate that 2-ClATP exerts either cell cycle arrest or cell death, acting neither on P2 nor on P1 receptors, but being extracellularly metabolized into 2-Cladenosine, intracellularly transported and re-phosphorylated.
Membrane-bound P2-receptors mediate the actions of extracellular nucleotides in cell-to-cell signalling. P2X-receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, whereas P2Y-receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. So far, the P2Y family is composed of eight cloned and functionally defined subtypes. Five of them (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6 and P2Y11) are present in human tissues. The P2Y3-, p2y8- and tp2y-receptors may be species orthologues. The principal physiological agonists of the cloned human P2Y-receptors are ADP (P2Y1), UTP/ATP (P2Y2), UTP (P2Y4), UDP (P2Y6) and ATP (P2Y11). The rat P2Y4-receptor is activated by both UTP and ATP. Specific patterns of polar amino acid residues in the exofacial portions of transmembrane domains (TMs) 6 and 7 of the P2Y-receptors may account for the ligand specificity of the subtypes. Suramin acts as an antagonist at most P2Y-receptors with the exception of P2Y4- and tp2y-receptors. PPADS has been shown to block P2Y1-, the human P2Y4- and P2Y6-receptors. The nucleotide analogue 2'-deoxy-N 6-methyladenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS 2179), in contrast, seems to be a potent and selective antagonist at the P2Y1-receptor. All cloned and functionally expressed P2Y-receptors are able to couple to phospholipase C. The P2Y11-receptor mediates in addition a stimulation of adenylate cyclase and the tp2y-receptor an inhibition of this signal transduction pathway. Other functionally defined subtypes, e.g., the receptor mediating an inhibition of adenylate cyclase in blood platelets, are not yet cloned.
The ADP-activated P2Y(1) receptor is broadly expressed and plays a crucial role in ADP-promoted platelet aggregation. We previously synthesized 2-iodo-N(6)-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2500), as a selective, high-affinity, competitive antagonist of this receptor. Here we report utilization of a trimethylstannyl precursor molecule for the multi-step radiochemical synthesis of a [(125)I]-labeled form of MRS2500. [(125)I]MRS2500 bound selectively to Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing the human P2Y(1) receptor but did not specifically bind to membranes isolated from empty vector-infected cells. Binding of [(125)I]MRS2500 to P2Y(1) receptors was saturable with a Kd of 1.2nM. Known agonists and antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor inhibited [(125)I]MRS2500 binding to P2Y(1) receptor-expressing membranes with potencies in agreement with those previously observed in functional assays of this receptor. A high-affinity binding site for [(125)I]MRS2500 also was observed on intact human platelets (Kd=0.61nM) and mouse platelets (Kd=1.20nM) that exhibited the pharmacological selectivity of the P2Y(1) receptor. The densities of sites observed were 151 sites/platelet and 229 sites/platelet in human and mouse platelets, respectively. In contrast, specific binding was not observed in platelets isolated from P2Y(1) receptor(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data illustrate the synthesis and characterization of a novel P2Y(1) receptor radioligand and its utility for examining P2Y(1) receptors natively expressed on human and mouse platelets.
