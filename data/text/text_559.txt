Abstract In the conversion of cadaverine into Δ 1 -piperideine, of putrescine into Δ 1 -pyrroline, and of agmatine into 4-guanidinobutanal, catalyzed by hog kidney diamine oxidase (DAO) (E.C. 1.4.3.6 diamine: oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating)), the si -H from C-1 of the substrate is removed while the re -H from C-1 of the substrate is maintained at the sp 2 C atom of each of the products. DAO catalyzed oxidation of cadaverine takes place without detectable isotope effect, while an intramolecular primary isotope effect ( k H si k H si = 4) is observed in the DAO catalyzed oxidation of putrescine. In conflict with earlier reports, incubation of cadaverine in deuterium oxide in the presence of bacterial l -lysine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.18) did not lead to entry of deuterium into the α-position of cadaverine. Likewise, l -ornithine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.17) did not catalyze exchange of the α-H of putrescine, nor did l -arginine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.19) catalyze such an exchange in agmatine.
