AA is a dibasic acid which rapidly deprotonates and undergoes oxidation to form L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) via the ascorbate m onoanion and an intermediate radical species [20] . Outside a narrow acidic pH range, hydrolysis o f DHA oc curs very fast by rupture o f the lactone ring and yields 2,3-dioxo-L-gulonic acid (DGulA). DGulA easily decarboxylizes to form 3,4,5-trihydroxy-2-oxo-L-valeraldehyde (TVA) [14, 21] , an a-ketoaldehyde. The above mentioned chiral com pounds were assumed to be produced via the BZ reaction of AA.
