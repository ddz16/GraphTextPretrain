A gram-positive Microbacterium sp. strain, ITRC1, that was able to degrade the persistent and toxic hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers was isolated and characterized. The ITRC1 strain has the capacity to degrade all four major isomers of HCH present in both liquid cultures and aged contaminated soil. DNA fragments corresponding to the two initial genes involved in gamma-HCH degradative pathway, encoding enzymes for gamma-pentachlorocyclohexene hydrolytic dehalogenase (linB) and a 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol dehydrogenase (linC), were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Their presence in the ITRC1 genomic DNA was also confirmed by Southern hybridization. Sequencing of the amplified DNA fragment revealed that the two genes present in the ITRC1 strain were homologous to those present in Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26. Both 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis resulted in the identification of the bacteria as a Microbacterium sp. We assume that these HCH-degrading bacteria evolved independently but possessed genes similar to S. paucimobilis UT26. The reported results indicate that catabolic genes for gamma-HCH degradation are highly conserved in diverse genera of bacteria, including the gram-positive groups, occurring in various environmental conditions.
In Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) is converted by two steps of dehydrochlorination to a chemically unstable intermediate, 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-TCDN), which is then metabolized to 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-DDOL) by two steps of hydrolytic dehalogenation via the chemically unstable intermediate 2,4,5-trichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-ol (2,4,5-DNOL). To clone a gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the conversion of the chemically unstable intermediates 1,4-TCDN and 2,4,5-DNOL, a genomic library of P. paucimobilis UT26 was constructed in Pseudomonas putida PpY101LA into which the linA gene had been introduced by Tn5. An 8-kb BglII fragment from one of the cosmid clones, which could convert gamma-HCH to 2,5-DDOL, was subcloned, and subsequent deletion analyses revealed that a ca. 1.1-kb region was responsible for the activity. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (designated the linB gene) of 885 bp within the region. The deduced amino acid sequence of LinB showed significant similarity to hydrolytic dehalogenase, DhlA (D. B. Janssen, F. Pries, J. van der Ploeg, B. Kazemier, P. Terpstra, and B. Witholt, J. Bacteriol. 171:6791-6799, 1989). The protein product of the linB gene was 32 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Not only 1-chlorobutane but also 1-chlorodecane (C10) and 2-chlorobutane, which are poor substrates for other dehalogenases, were good substrates for LinB, suggesting that LinB may be a member of haloalkane dehalogenases with broad-range specificity for substrates.
In Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) is converted to 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-DDOL), which is then metabolized to 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone. Here, we isolated from the genomic library of UT26 two genes which expressed 2,5-DDOL dehydrogenase activity when they were transformed into P. putida and Escherichia coli. Both gene products had an apparent molecular size of 28 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first gene, named linC, located separately from the two genes (linA and linB) which we had already cloned as genes involved in the gamma-HCH degradation. The other, named linX, located about 1 kb upstream of the linA gene encoding gamma-HCH dehydrochlorinase. A gamma-HCH degradation-negative mutant, named UT72, which lacked the whole linC gene but had the intact linX gene was isolated. The linC gene given in a plasmid could complement UT72. These results strongly suggest that the linC gene but not the linX gene is essential for the assimilation of gamma-HCH in UT26. Deduced amino acid sequences of LinC and LinX show homology to those of members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.
A γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)-degrading bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. MM-1, was isolated from soil contaminated with HCH isomers. Cultivation of MM-1 in the presence of γ-HCH led to the detection of five γ-HCH metabolites, γ-pentachlorocyclohexene, 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol, 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and 2,5-dichlorophenol, strongly suggesting that MM-1 has the lin genes for γ-HCH degradation originally identified in the well-studied γ-HCH-degrading strain Sphingobium japonicum UT26. Southern blot, PCR amplification, and sequencing analyses indicated that MM-1 has seven lin genes for the conversion of γ-HCH to β-ketoadipate (six structural genes, linA to linF, and one regulatory gene, linR). MM-1 carried four plasmids, of 200, 50, 40, and 30 kb. Southern blot analysis revealed that all seven lin genes were dispersed across three of the four plasmids, and that IS6100, often found close to the lin genes, was present on all four plasmids.
A -hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)-degrading bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. MM-1, was isolated from soil contaminated with HCH isomers. Cultivation of MM-1 in the presence of -HCH led to the detection of five -HCH metabolites, -pentachlorocyclohexene, 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol, 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and 2,5-dichlorophenol, strongly suggesting that MM-1 has the lin genes for -HCH degradation originally identified in the wellstudied -HCH-degrading strain Sphingobium japonicum UT26. Southern blot, PCR amplification, and sequencing analyses indicated that MM-1 has seven lin genes for the conversion of -HCH to -ketoadipate (six structural genes, linA to linF, and one regulatory gene, linR). MM-1 carried four plasmids, of 200, 50, 40, and 30 kb. Southern blot analysis revealed that all seven lin genes were dispersed across three of the four plasmids, and that IS6100, often found close to the lin genes, was present on all four plasmids.
Abstract 14 CO 2 was evolved from 14 C-γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) at a rate of 9.3% of the applied 14 C during 4-days aerobical incubation with Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26(UT26). 2,5-Dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-DDOL) and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone(2,5-DCHQ) were newly identified as aerobic degradation products of γ-HCH. It was elucidated that 2,5-DDOL was degraded to 2,5-DCHQ, which was further degraded to mineralization. 2,5-DDOL was considered to be produced through unidentified intermediates, 1,3,4,6-tetrachlorocyclohexa-1,4-diene(1,4-TCDN) and 2,4,5-trichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-ol(2,4,5-DNOL), by two steps of dechlorinative hydroxylation. These results indicated that UT26 mineralized γ-HCH to CO 2 via 1,4-TCDN, 2,4,5-DNOL, 2,5-DDOL and 2,5-DCHQ. The aerobical mineralization of γ-HCH by UT26 is considered to be very noticeable from a viewpoint of bioremediation of the contaminated environment.
Abstract Bioremediation of anthropogenic organic pollutants in cold climates is often limited by lower microbial or enzyme activity induced by low temperature. The present study addressed this issue through the degradation of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) by three Sphingobium strains ( S. indicum B90A, S. japonicum UT26 and S. francense Sp+) under low temperature (4 °C). After 5 days incubation at 4 °C, 79.7% and 43.8% of 5 and 25 mg L −1 of γ-HCH added were degraded, respectively by the inoculation of 1.75 × 10 7 cells mL −1 of S. indicum B90A. An increase in inoculum concentration to 1.72 × 10 8 cells mL −1 significantly increased the degradation to 98.1 ± 1.7% of 5 mg L −1 within 24 h. Further, S. indicum B90A and S. japonicum UT26 can rapidly degrade γ-HCH at 4 °C, while the degradation capability of S. francense Sp+ is relatively low. At 4 °C, γ-HCH is transformed to extremely low amounts of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) and 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) by S. indicum B90A, but most of γ-HCH were transformed to 2,5-Dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diol (2,5-DDOL) by S. japonicum UT26. These results revealed that haloalkane dehalogenases in some Sphingobium species are very active at temperature as low as 4 °C and S. indicum B90A might be a good candidate for developing novel bioremediation techniques for cold regions to decontaminate γ-HCH from soils/waters.
